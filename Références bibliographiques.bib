	abstract = {Mining poses serious and highly specific threats to biodiversity. However, mining can also be a means for financing alternative livelihood paths that, over the long-term, may prevent biodiversity loss. Complex and controversial issues associated with mining and biodiversity conservation are often simplified within a narrow frame oriented towards the negative impacts of mining at the site of extraction, rather than posed as a series of challenges for the conservation science community to embrace. Here, we synthesize core issues that, if better understood, may ensure coexistence between mining and conservation agendas. We illustrate how mining impacts biodiversity through diverse pathways and across spatial scales. We argue that traditional, site-based conservation approaches will have limited effect in preventing biodiversity loss against an increasing mining footprint, but opportunities to improve outcomes (e.g. through long-term strategic assessment and planning) do exist. While future mineral supply is uncertain, projections suggest demand will grow for many metals and shift mining operations towards more dispersed and biodiverse areas. Initiating dialogue between mining companies, policy-makers and conservation organizations is urgent, given the suite of international agendas simultaneously requiring more minerals but less biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Much of Canada’s terrestrial biodiversity is supported by boreal forests. Natural resource development in boreal forests poses risks to this biodiversity. This paper reviews the scientific literature to assess the effects of natural resource development on terrestrial biodiversity in Canadian boreal forests. We address four questions: (1) To what extent have Canadian boreal forests changed due to natural resource development? (2) How has biodiversity responded to these changes? (3) Will the biodiversity of second-growth forests converge with that of primary boreal forests? (4) Are we losing species from boreal forests? We focus on trees, understory plants, insects, fungi, selected mammals, and songbirds because these groups have been most studied. We review more than 600 studies and found that changes in community composition are prevalent in response to large-scale conversion of forest types, changes in stand structures and age distributions, and altered landscape structure resulting from forest management and habitat loss associated with other developments such as oil and gas, hydroelectric, and mining. The southern boreal forest has been more highly impacted than the north due to more extensive forest management and the cumulative effects of multiple forms of development. There is abundant evidence that most species are not in danger of being extirpated from the boreal forest due to these anthropogenic changes. A few species, including woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), have, however, undergone long-term range contractions. Significant gaps in our ability to assess the effects of natural resource development on biodiversity in the boreal zone are the lack of long-term spatial and population data to monitor the impact of forest changes on ecosystems and species.},

	abstract = {Much of Canada’s industrial sector is driven by natural resources and relies heavily on provisioning services supplied by the boreal zone. However, the sometimes intensive processes used by resource-based industries and their associated infrastructure have significantly altered the region, creating concerns over the future socio-ecological health of the boreal zone. Addressing these concerns will require industries reliant on natural resources from the boreal zone to innovate their processes, management, and infrastructure to improve extraction efficiency while contributing to society’s increasing expectations related to sustainability. Here, we explore past, current, and future trends in industrial innovation and infrastructure in the boreal zone for forestry, mining, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and renewable sources of power generation. We assess the role of innovation on the future socio-ecological state of the boreal zone by considering interactions between innovation in industry and infrastructure and other key drivers of change in the boreal, such as atmospheric changes, changing demands for nonprovisioning and provisioning ecosystem services, governance, and demographics and social values. We present future scenarios highlighting three divergent trajectories of change in boreal ecosystems based on past and current states of innovation in industry and infrastructure. We suggest that minimizing impacts of natural resource extraction activities in the boreal zone will only be possible through innovation directly focused on reducing the human footprint on the landscape. Innovation in the information technology sector related to process, management, and end products within these industries and placing greater emphasis on cross-sectoral collaboration will be key to achieving this goal.},

	abstract = {The legacy of orphaned/abandoned mines, with their associated environmental liability, human health concerns and the financial costs of clean up, is a serious issue facing Canada. Canada’s long history in mining has resulted in more than 10,000 orphaned or abandoned sites, requiring varying degrees of rehabilitation. Mining regions have become less remote, and are often located close to populated areas, including many Aboriginal communities. A key priority of the federal Department of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is to promote the participation of Aboriginal communities in mining activities, including orphan and abandoned mines. Mining is generally regulated at the provincial level, although the federal department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada maintains most of the responsibility for mines in northern Canada. The National Orphaned/Abandoned Mines Initiative (NOAMI) was established in 2002, in response to the request of the Canadian Mines Ministers that a multi-stakeholder advisory committee be set-up to study various issues and initiatives concerning the development of partnerships in the implementation of remediation programs across Canada. NOAMI is a co-operative Canadian program that is guided by an Advisory Committee consisting of the mining industry, federal/provincial/territorial governments, environmental non-government organizations and Aboriginal Canadians1. This paper will present an overview of the scope of issues surrounding abandoned mines in Canada, and programs that have been initiated to address the problem.},

	abstract = {Open-pit mining operations often produce large amounts of waste rock that are characterized by large particle size distributions (PSD). Waste rock are normally deposited in surface piles that contain grains varying from a few microns to meters in size. Furthermore, the mineralogical and textural properties of the waste rock are inﬂuenced by their PSD. The diameter of physical locking of sulﬁdes (DPLS) is a newly suggested parameter that was deﬁned using an automated mineralogy system to separate waste rock according to their geochemical reactivity. Three lithologies (A, B, and C) were extracted from an open-pit gold mine and their geochemical behaviors, with respect to degree of sulﬁde liberation, were evaluated using column kinetic tests. The main results of this study showed that ﬁne fractions of the studied waste rock were more sulﬁdic compared to coarse fractions. Moreover, sulﬁde liberation was negligible for fractions {\textgreater} 2.4 mm. Consequently, 2.4 mm was deﬁned as the critical diameter of sulﬁde reactivity for the three studied waste rock. Column kinetic tests were used to conﬁrm this hypothesis and to assess the geochemical behavior of the three lithologies. Geochemical analyses of leachates from the column tests showed that pH values remained between 7 and 8 and the instantaneous concentrations of metals such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) were below environmental limits over the entire test duration (543 days). Considering sample reactivity, the data showed that the ﬁne fractions primarily control the geochemical behavior of total samples. Sulﬁde oxidation rates were high for fractions {\textless} 2.4 mm, whereas they were negligible for fractions {\textgreater} 2.4 mm; total samples showed intermediate rates. For example, in lithology B, pyrite oxidation rates were 12.46 μmol/kg/day, 2.43 μmol/kg/day, and 0.27 μmol/kg/day for the ﬁne fraction ({\textless} 2.4 mm), total sample ({\textless} 5 cm), and coarse fraction ({\textgreater} 2.4 mm) respectively. Sulﬁde and carbonate contents and their liberation were deﬁned as key factors controlling the geochemical behavior of the studied waste rock, which was conﬁrmed by the correlation factor between calcium leaching vs. carbonate liberation and between sulfur leaching vs. sulﬁde liberation. The coarse, unreactive fraction ({\textgreater} 2.4 mm) comprised a high proportion of the total sample weight (up to 90 wt. \%). Screening waste rock, after blasting, according to the critical diameter of sulﬁde reactivity could be an eﬃcient technique for global waste rock management that will reduce the economic costs related to waste rock pile reclamation.},

However, little is known about its offsite impacts on plant communities. We assessed the frequency and the abundance of five common boreal understorey plant species (Coptis trifolia (L.) Salisb., Cornus canadensis L., Linnaea borealis L., Lysimachia borealis (Raf.) U.Manns \& Anderb., and Maianthemum canadense Desf.) at different distances around six mines in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec (Québec). Frequency and (or) abundance of Coptis trifolia and M. canadense decreased near mines, suggesting that they might be sensitive to the loss of forest cover, particle deposition, and soil contamination induced by mining. Conversely, the frequency and abundance of Cornus canadensis increased near active mines, which indicates its resilience to the stress caused by mines and its ability to exploit the niche space left by more sensitive species. No effects on Linnaea borealis and Lysimachia borealis were observed. Our study suggests the possible presence of offsite impacts of mines on plant communities. Further studies considering enigmatic impacts should be conducted in order to develop our understanding of the broader environmental footprint of mining activity.},

              The simultaneous impact of climate change and human activities on soil organic carbon content (SOC) in peatlands is insufficiently recognized, especially in relation to peatlands affected by open‐pit lignite mining. Given their importance in climate change feedback loops, long‐term observations of SOC changes in peatlands are essential. The aim of the study was to determine recent changes in the properties and SOC content/stock of agro‐managed fen peatlands located adjacent to open‐pit lignite mines. We studied two soil layers (0–20 and 20–40 cm) within 12 sampling plots in the Grójec Valley (Central Poland). Soil sample collection and field measurements took place in 2005 and again in 2015. The largest negative changes in soil properties (e.g. SOC content drop from 208 to 318 g kg
              −1
              in 2005 to 125–263 g kg
              −1
              in 2015 and SOC stock decrease from 12.1–16.2 kg m
              −2
              in 2005 to 9.22–14.5 kg m
              −2
              in 2015), as well as the largest variability of watertable level were recorded in the northern part of the study area, affected by long‐term lignite mining (1982–2009). While such a strong changes were not observed in the plots from central and southern part of the valley (230–439 g kg
